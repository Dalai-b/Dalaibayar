          I like to go on mini-runs especially in nature or nature surrounded
          areas. I also like to ride my bike a lot with my friends going to
          places and sometimes going geogaching with them. Although tiring i
          also like working out because it makes me feel alive and gives me a
          good feeling about bettering myself, and occasionally i work out with
          my friends or my older brother.

            On sunday our family does a deep cleaning in our house, and it takes
            all day but after that we spend more time with eachother, and
            probably go out to somewhere, which i never get tired of, especially
            if our whole family goes together.
